Based on the training results from your YOLOv8 large model (yolov8l), here is the modelâ€™s final performance:

ðŸ“Š Model Accuracy Summary
Precision (P): 92.8%
â†’ When the model predicts a class, it is correct ~93% of the time.

Recall (R): 81.2%
â†’ It detects ~81% of all actual positive instances.

mAP@0.5 (Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold 0.5): 83.8%
â†’ A strong metric showing object detection performance on clear matches.

mAP@0.5:0.95: 55.1%
â†’ More strict metric considering varying IoU thresholds. This score is typical for object detection tasks requiring precise localization.

âœ… Interpretation
Your model is very precise, meaning false positives are rare.

Recall is good, but there's room to improve in catching all issues (e.g., zip_not_secured was weaker).

mAP@0.5 is solid, showing reliable detection.

If you're using this model for lab entry decision-making, itâ€™s already quite usable, especially with a confidence threshold like 0.4 (from F1-optimal curve).

Would you like:

A rule engine to convert detections into an "accept/reject" decision?

Suggestions to improve recall or performance for weaker classes (like zip_not_secured or gown_torn)?
